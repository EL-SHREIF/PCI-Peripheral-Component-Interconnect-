<h1># PCI-Peripheral-Component-Interconnect</h1>
<h2>The project is divide into 2 parts :</h2>
<h2>The first one :</h2>
    <p>the veilog (hard ware description language) of the PCI Bus and how the Devices will deal with Arbiter Circuit .</p>
<h2>The Second Part :</h2> 
    <p>A c++ QT GUI that show the connection of the pci and the changing in signals and memory while diffrent transactions .</p>

## Weâ€™re Building an Open Source CI-Peripheral-Component-Interconnect


<h2>The project is divide into 2 parts :</h2>
<h2>The first one :</h2>
    <p>the veilog (hard ware description language) of the PCI Bus and how the Devices will deal with Arbiter Circuit .</p>
<h2>The Second Part :</h2> 
    <p>A c++ QT GUI that show the connection of the pci and the changing in signals and memory while diffrent transactions .</p>


## How to Run
-for the hardware (verilog) code you will need to copy it in modelsim or xilion and debug in it
-for the GUI you can run the excutable file only .

#### Challenges
Hardware : it was diffecult to make diffrent modes from the Arbiter Circuit like : (Round Roben - First Come First Serve - Piroity ) and also about how to make the device handle all the cases and communicate with the device to read and write 
GUI : it make instance of 3 devices with the arbiter and it enable you to read and to write and show you the signals and waveforms .



**You can find the output in the following pictures.**
